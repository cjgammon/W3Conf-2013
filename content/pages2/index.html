The Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago occupies the sixth floor of 1 Prudential Plaza, an aging forty-one-story tower that, for a brief period in the nineteen-fifties, was Chicago’s tallest building. Suite 600 retains some of the hip ethos of the 2008 campaign. A large design department churns out stylish Obama signage, which decorates the office. On the day that I visited this fall, dozens of young, casually dressed staffers, many sitting on exercise balls, were lined up at long rows of tables, hunched over Macs. Some seats were empty, as personnel had begun to filter out to the battleground states, to participate in the ground game—the hard work of finding voters and getting them to turn out.
The man who oversees this near-billion-dollar enterprise is a wiry, ginger-haired political operative and former Senate staffer named Jim Messina. Before landing the title of campaign manager, earlier this year, Messina, who is forty-three, spent four years working for Obama in other capacities. In 2008, he became known as the Fixer, because, he told me at the time, “I handle what people on the campaign call shit sandwiches. If it goes wrong, I have to deal with it.” It was his job to sort out conflicts that erupted after aides from the defeated primary campaign of Hillary Clinton were hired, and, in general, to keep the campaign on an even keel. In 2008, after Sarah Palin was picked as John McCain’s running mate, Messina said, “I was kind of on bed-wetter patrol, dealing with members of the Senate and the House, who were freaking out” at the possibility of Palin’s revitalizing McCain’s campaign. Messina’s role was institutionalized at the White House when he became Obama’s deputy chief of staff for operations. His most delicate assignment, in 2009, entailed negotiating the controversial industry deals that led to the passage of Obama’s health-care law, including favorable provisions for the pharmaceutical industry.
Messina and other White House aides with long congressional experience were often at odds with Obama aides who worried that the President’s image would be tarnished if the White House made unsavory compromises with lobbyists. During one White House meeting after the pharmaceutical deal had been cut, Messina and Rahm Emanuel, his boss, found themselves defending it against both David Axelrod, a senior adviser, and Robert Gibbs, a press secretary, who hated the deal. “Neither one of you has ever passed a fucking bill in your life,” Emanuel said, speaking for himself and Messina, according to someone who was present. “And you know why this hasn’t passed for seventy years? Because no one knows how to do it. And we do.”
Messina, with his relish for executing the President’s most overtly political missions, was the ideal man for the kind of campaign that Obama would have to run in 2012. In a weak economy, hope and change would not work, and steady reminders about the situation Obama had inherited would not suffice. Later, on the day I visited, Messina was scheduled to go to Washington to brief Democratic senators on the state of the campaign. In his office, he explained his general strategy. Perhaps the biggest decision was to spend twenty per cent of the campaign’s total budget on a summer television-advertising blitz attacking Romney. The decision required the President’s approval, and carried a significant risk: Obama could be badly outspent by Romney in the final weeks of the election. Messina showed me a chart: between January and July of 2012, Republicans had invested a hundred and sixty-three million dollars in television ads, but from August through November, he estimated, the total would be a hundred and eighty-two million. Obama’s ad spending would be the reverse: saturation levels in the summer but more modest in the final weeks of the campaign.

The idea was to try to define Romney early, while he was recovering from the primary, racing around the country raising money to replace depleted funds. The iconic Obama ad, which ran repeatedly, had Romney singing—poorly—“America the Beautiful” as a series of stark facts appeared on the screen: “In business, Mitt Romney’s firms shipped jobs to Mexico and China. . . . As governor, Romney outsourced jobs to India. . . . He had millions in a Swiss bank account . . . Tax havens like Bermuda . . . And the Cayman Islands. . . . Mitt Romney’s not the solution. He’s the problem.”
The decision to run an early negative campaign has worked well for other incumbents. In 1972, supporters of Richard Nixon famously associated George McGovern with “amnesty, abortion, and acid.” Bill Clinton launched an ad campaign against his eventual opponent, Bob Dole, a full year before the 1996 general election, that highlighted Dole’s cuts to Medicare and other popular government programs. In 2004, George W. Bush tagged John Kerry as an out-of-touch liberal and a flip-flopper before Kerry could gain his bearings after the hard-fought Democratic primaries. As one senior Obama official said, unabashedly, the 2004 and 2012 campaigns are “mirror images” of each other: “They made Kerry an unacceptable alternative, and we’ve done that to Romney.” For a while, it seemed to be working. By the time the general-election campaign began, Romney had become the first Presidential candidate of either party in the past seven elections to start September with his approval rating upside down: more voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of him than a favorable one.
Messina, who pointed out that the campaign also spent thirty million dollars on positive ads boosting Obama, believed the early advertising was crucial, given the deluge of political ads that would hit voters in the fall. “October TV matters less,” he said. “We decided to make a grand bet.” But there was more to the strategy than just damaging Romney. Messina’s bet was the first stage of a two-part strategy. Over the past four Presidential election cycles, even as campaign strategists have spent more on the blunt instrument of TV advertising (the air war), the work being done at the grass-roots level to reach voters in person (the ground game) has become far more important. As Messina described it, the summer airwave blitz would soften up the opponent in the eyes of voters, but victory would be carried home by Obama’s volunteer army on the ground.
“We believe that, in this age of saturation television, eventually people are going to throw their TV as far as they can out of their window, and look to their neighbors and family to have a discussion about how they’re going to vote,” Messina said. “And we’re going to be integral to that moment—that is our entire moment.” What could go wrong?
Obama’s 2012 campaign began in December of 2008. As many of the campaign staff were packing up for Washington to work in the new Administration, Jeremy Bird, who had run operations in Ohio, travelled to Chicago to start working on Obama’s reëlection. Along with a group of ten or so mid-level campaign workers, Bird conducted a rigorous study of the President’s victory over McCain, analyzing what had worked in 2008 and what had not. As the national field director, Bird, thirty-four, now oversees the campaign’s ground game nationwide.
Bird’s team was roughly divided between data-crunching experts and field experts who had run swing states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. “We did thousands of phone interviews with organizers and volunteers,” Bird told me. “We brought them in in small groups. We looked at everything. What did we learn about organizing the African-American community? What did we learn about organizing the Latino community? What did we learn about organizing rural communities? What did we learn about organizing and management in general?” After two months, they wrote up their findings in a memo—a postmortem that formed the blueprint for the 2012 effort. This eventually became a detailed field manual instructing top Obama operatives in how to build and train a volunteer network and win in the most competitive states.
Thin and bespectacled, Bird grew up in Missouri, the son of devout Baptist parents. He went on to Harvard Divinity School, where he studied conflict resolution and the role of religion in politics and war. One of his professors, Marshall Ganz, a veteran organizer of Southern blacks in the civil-rights era and for United Farm Workers in California, introduced him to an organizing philosophy that emphasizes what Ganz describes as “the role of storytelling—and emotion—in motivating participation.” In Ganz’s class, Bird found himself in the middle of a successful campaign that organized kids in Dorchester and Roxbury with the aim of persuading the Boston city council to veto the mayor’s budget and increase funding for their schools. “I loved it,” Bird said. “It just spoke to everything I wanted to do. The change that we made on a small scale got me interested in politics.” He wondered what would happen, he said, “if you could replicate that on a bigger scale.” He worked for Howard Dean in 2003, and for John Kerry in 2004. When Bird learned that Barack Obama, who was then on his way to the U.S. Senate, had studied and practiced the same kind of community organizing he had learned, he vowed to work for Obama if he ever ran for President. By 2007, Ganz had become an adviser to the national campaign and Bird was organizing Obama’s primary campaign in South Carolina. There he applied Ganz’s philosophy, adding to it new technological tools for mobilizing voters.
Bird shares a cramped office with Mitch Stewart, a fellow-organizer. Maps of the swing states cover the walls. In the past decade, campaigns have increasingly relied on empirical research to determine the best way to get voters to the polls. Bird’s effort was a refinement of that approach. Almost everything that a modern Presidential campaign does to garner votes falls into two categories: persuasion and mobilization. For decades, persuasion was considered the key to winning, and the gurus and the consultants promised candidates that they could craft messages to win over uncommitted voters. As television ads became the dominant method of persuasion, ad-makers, such as Bob Shrum and Roger Ailes, became rich and famous, while unknown operatives like Bird were starved for resources.
But, as the electorate has become increasingly polarized, campaign tacticians have become focussed more on getting their own voters to the polls than on persuading others to change their allegiance. In the past three Presidential elections, there has been a marked decline in the number of Americans likely to be persuaded to vote for the opposing party. According to the American National Election Studies, “ticket splitters”—voters who cast ballots for a Republican and a Democrat—decreased from thirty per cent, in 1972, to nineteen per cent, in 2000. After the 1996 election, many labor unions, long the most important outside group to spend money on behalf of Democratic candidates, shifted from reaching voters through TV advertising to contacting these voters personally. Undecided voters, who make up only about six per cent of the electorate this year, are often ideologically incoherent, which makes it difficult to craft an effective pitch to them. “We consultants hate undecided voters,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who ran McCain’s 2000 Presidential campaign and Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign, said. “Independents voted for Obama, and then, twenty-four months later, they voted for Republicans.”
In 2000, Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s political strategist, planned to use a Bush Presidency to realign American politics around a new Republican majority that would attract disaffected Democrats and a segment of the growing Latino population. Going into Election Day, Rove was so certain that Bush would win by a comfortable margin that he sent Bush to campaign in California, a state he ended up losing by twelve points. Bush went on to lose the popular vote by half a million ballots, and he secured the Presidency only after the Supreme Court suspended the monthlong recount of ballots in Florida. Many Republican operatives became convinced that the Democrats’ superior ground game, energized by the unions’ shift, nearly cost their candidate the election.
The operatives gradually conceded that motivating conservatives and winning by narrow margins was a better strategy. Rove instructed the Republican National Committee to reinvest in registering voters and building its turnout operations. In a memo after the 2000 campaign, another Bush strategist, Matthew Dowd, wrote that 2004 would be a “motivation election,” according to Sasha Issenberg’s recent book, “The Victory Lab.” Rove didn’t give up entirely on his original vision of a new majority. Bush managed to increase his share of the Hispanic vote from thirty-five per cent, in 2000, to forty-four per cent, in 2004. But finding and turning out dependable Republicans became far more important. Rove created the 72-Hour Task Force, named for the crucial final three days of an election, which studied the Democrats’ ground-game activities; he also implemented a standard grass-roots voter-contact program that all Republican campaigns could use. The R.N.C. even sent an eighteen-wheeler—Reggie the Registration Rig—around the country to nascar events and country-music shows to mobilize Republicans. The Party registered more than three million new voters in the run-up to Bush’s reëlection. Since then, both parties have been obsessed with voter-turnout programs, though the relative strength of their operations has fluctuated.
Obama’s 2008 effort was distinguished by its organization and its scale, which enabled it to recruit voters in unprecedented numbers. New voters, especially African-Americans, Hispanics, the young, and highly educated whites—the four pillars of the modern Democratic Party—ended up favoring Obama over McCain by seventy-one per cent to twenty-seven per cent. Over all, Obama’s winning margin was fifty-three per cent to forty-six per cent. Without those voters, according to David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager, Obama would have squeaked by with a fifty- to forty-nine-per-cent victory.
From his study of the 2008 campaign, Bird concluded that the single most effective medium in reaching a potential Obama voter was not TV ads or glossy mail but contact from an enthusiastic human being. The general election proved that the strategy could be implemented on a national level. For 2012, with Obama struggling amid a weak economy and high unemployment, Bird would have to build something even more decisive. “It’s got to be massive, because you’re talking about millions of voters,” he said. “But the beauty about being on the ground for so long is that we are now able to have that kind of volume.”
The campaign press devotes a great deal of attention to the political voodoo of micro-targeting, which seeks to tailor messages to individual voters based on algorithms that combine hundreds of pieces of consumer data and new technology, such as mobile apps and Web-based tools, to organize voters. The Obama team’s iPhone app pairs mapping software with public information about voters to guide a canvasser through a neighborhood as he or she knocks on doors. But there is scant evidence that these advances are changing politics to the extent advertised. “Some of the targeting is better, the modelling is better,” one of Obama’s top organizers said. “The online tools are better, and the iPhone app that we have is great. But none of it is a big, dramatic departure from what we did last time. The most important thing is making sure we have the ground infrastructure in place, so we can knock on people’s doors and talk to people face to face as much as we can.”
Bird referred me to a book called “Get Out the Vote,” by two Ivy League social scientists, Donald P. Green and Alan S. Gerber, that summarizes what was learned during the course of ten election cycles, from 1998 to 2007, about increasing voter turnout. For Bird and other organizers, it has served as a sort of bible. Green and Gerber upend much of the conventional wisdom that has been passed down by campaign consultants. Automated calls, they found, generate only one vote per nine hundred calls. Blanketing a neighborhood with campaign flyers is not significantly more effective than doing nothing at all. Sending out mass e-mails to encourage people to vote is useless.
The best way to mobilize voters, they discovered, is through shame. During the 2006 Michigan primary, they sent four pieces of campaign mail to more than three hundred thousand people urging them to vote. One mailer was a simple appeal to the voters’ civic duty. The other three included such an appeal, coupled with either information about whether the recipients or their neighbors had voted in recent elections or a subtle warning that researchers would check to see if they voted in the next election. The mailers with the shame-inducing information increased turnout by as much as eight points, an enormous jump. “Many non-voters will vote if they think that others are watching,” Green and Gerber concluded. “Some of the strongest experimental effects occur when voters are reminded that voting is a matter of public record.”
The finding confirmed that persuading a non-voter to vote is more of a psychological and social exercise than a purely rational appeal to one’s ideology or preference on any given issue. Gerber and Green concluded, “We do not see much evidence that what you communicate matters.” Personal invitations work, as do visits to a voter’s home and phone calls from volunteers who aren’t reading from a script. This suggests that the decision to vote is most strongly affected “when voters are placed in a social milieu that urges their participation.” More than a decade of social science has essentially reinforced what Bird learned about motivational organizing from Ganz at Harvard—and, for that matter, what Obama learned about community organizing in Chicago, in the mid-eighties.
During the 2008 primaries, when Bird was organizing South Carolina for Obama, he ignored the advice of local political leaders about how to rally voters, and encouraged Obama campaign staffers to embed themselves in places like barbershops and beauty salons, which became hubs for organizers in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. The campaign now employs the tactic nationally. The shops are stocked with campaign literature, information about how to volunteer, and voter-registration forms. The owners often collect materials from clients, which Obama aides then pick up on regular rounds, and even join special campaign conference calls just for barbers and hairdressers. An owner once told Bird, “You go to church to get the good, to the prison to get the bad, and to the barbershop to get the real.”
In the 2008 general election, the campaign created more than seven hundred inexpensive Obama field offices, mostly in the battleground states. The network enabled them to reach voters personally, on a scale similar to what could be achieved through TV ads. One academic study, which examined the correlation between the number of Obama field offices and voting results at the county level, determined that the offices—and, by implication, the scores of staffers who worked out of them—increased Obama’s national vote by almost one point and were the deciding factor in his winning Florida, Indiana, and North Carolina.
“It’s not like we came up with this whole new way of organizing,” Bird said. “It’s just that it’s able to be much, much more local.” The size of the operation also means that Bird and his colleagues can run their own in-house scientific experiments. Bird often divides groups of volunteers into test and control groups in order to determine the most effective messages that might influence voters. In the 2008 memo, Bird reported that, whenever organizers or volunteers were on teams that included more than ten people, they began to feel less like crusaders for Obama and more “like they were just a number on a spreadsheet,” and they were more likely to quit. The 2012 Obama campaign reorganized itself around this fact, and, despite Obama’s less inspiring campaign message, retention rates have climbed.
A few days after talking to Bird, I travelled to Nevada, which was devastated by the foreclosure crisis and is still grappling with a twelve-per-cent unemployment rate. On the outskirts of Las Vegas, roads are unfinished and houses sit half-built. An estimated seven per cent of the electorate is Mormon, and is increasingly mobilized, which gave Romney an easy victory in the Nevada caucus in February. Yet Romney has not led in any of the twenty-five publicly available polls taken this year. Even after Obama’s confounding performance in the first Presidential debate, on October 3rd, polls continued to show Romney lagging slightly behind in Nevada.
As the polls have tightened elsewhere this fall, Nevada has become more important to Obama. Romney has made gains in North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and New Hampshire. If Romney wins all of those states, and Obama holds on to Ohio and Wisconsin, where he has maintained leads, he will need to win Nevada or Iowa. Given Iowa’s overwhelmingly white electorate and its relative immunity to the positive effects of the auto-industry bailout, which has helped Obama in other Midwestern states, his fate could hinge on winning Nevada.
The same demographic trends that the Obama campaign exploited in 2008 have continued apace in Nevada. The number of Latinos grew from ten per cent of the electorate, in 2004, to fifteen per cent, in 2008, an increase that helped Obama win Nevada by twelve and a half points—twice what polls projected before Election Day. Since 2008, the adult Latino citizen population has grown by thirty-nine per cent, according to the Obama campaign. “I can’t believe there’s a better operation in this country than the state Democratic Party here,” said Jon Ralston, a longtime, nonpartisan columnist for the Las Vegas Sun, who now runs his own Web site about Nevada politics. In September, 2000, Republicans had a registration advantage of slightly more than forty-five hundred voters. By September, 2012, Democrats had an advantage of more than a hundred and fifteen thousand voters. “Think about that,” Ralston said. “The economy here had a cataclysm in the last few years, and the Republicans have not been able to increase their numbers against the Democrats.”
Obama’s advantage in the state can be explained, to some extent, by idiosyncratic local factors. The state’s Republican Party has been taken over by Ron Paul activists, a development that forced the Republican National Committee to set up a shadow party to work for Romney. But the demography of Nevada, combined with the organizational prowess of the local Obama team, has been able to overcome the problem of the dismal economy.
“When the housing industry goes, the contracting jobs go, and when the construction jobs go it hits the Latino population,” Daron Shaw, a political scientist who worked with Rove and Matthew Dowd in 2000 and 2004 to develop Bush’s electoral-college strategies, said. “In a place like Nevada, a big impact of the recession has fallen on either union employees or Latinos, and they’re either organized or, for other reasons, are Democratic to the point where they’re not willing to support Romney.”
Obama has twenty-six field offices in the state; Romney has twelve. When I visited, twenty-five days before the deadline for registering new voters, the Obama outposts had been transformed into voter-registration sweatshops, with volunteers grinding away at data entry and voter contact. I stopped by an Obama office in Las Vegas, on the edge of the city. It made Obama’s Chicago headquarters look lavish: concrete floor, metal folding chairs, brown Formica tables. A dozen people were making calls as part of a statewide effort to reach forty-seven thousand voters—a symbolic nod to Romney’s dismissive comment about forty-seven per cent of the electorate. Katherine Tran, who at forty-six had just moved to Las Vegas from Orange County, California, was taking stacks of completed voter-registration cards and capturing the information in a database system called VoteBuilder. Her colleague a few seats away then called every new registrant to see if he or she would become an Obama volunteer.
Tran wasn’t effusive in her praise of Obama, but she liked what she heard about his health-care law. If she had to have car insurance, why shouldn’t she have health insurance? She thought he was doing O.K., despite the odds. “I feel that the President is trying his best,” she said. “It’s just really hard, you know?”
It got a lot harder a few days later. After the first debate, Democrats in the state began to panic. “People said, ‘What happened to the President?’ ” Al Martinez, the head of Nevada’s Service Employees International Union, said. “They felt that he let Romney just rush out and step on him. People were really concerned.”
Jim Messina’s bet on an early ad blitz took into account recent changes in voting patterns. In Chicago, he showed me a chart that tracked the percentage of voters who voted on or before Election Day, in 2008, in ten crucial states. In Nevada, Florida, North Carolina, and Colorado, the chart showed, a majority of votes were cast early or by mail. In Colorado, only twenty-two per cent of all votes were from voters who went to the polls on Election Day; in Nevada, the number was only thirty-seven per cent. Why spend money on advertising to persuade voters who have already cast their ballots? Instead, more effort could be spent on the ground game, which now dominates the final two months of the campaign.
But Romney’s success in the first debate, and his ability to quickly change the contours of the election, revealed a flaw in Messina’s early-attack strategy. “If you spend money in July and August killing somebody, you get great July, August, or even September polls,” Mike Murphy, the Republican strategist, told me. Murphy made his career helping vulnerable incumbents, mostly U.S. senators and governors, execute a version of Obama’s 2012 campaign strategy. “But if your guy’s in trouble, the beaten-up challenger can still come back to life in the last few weeks,” he said. “It’s like a horror movie. All of a sudden, the hand comes out from the ground—it’s alive!” Despite Messina’s insistence that October ads are nearly useless, the Obama campaign is back on the air at peak levels, trying to rebury Romney.
Messina may have overestimated the impact of the early television advertising. “Most of the effect of Presidential ads decays in two to three days,” Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at U.C.L.A., who has studied the issue closely, said. Also, if the challenger proves not to be as monstrous as depicted in the ads, the focus can quickly return to the President’s flaws, a tendency that Romney’s team exploited. “Burying your opponent in preëmptive, negative ads before they can define themselves is easy, fun, and effective,” Murphy said. But, he added, if you haven’t addressed voters’ concerns about your performance, the race, once again, becomes a referendum on you.
In the first debate, Obama’s reluctance to take on Romney gave the impression that he didn’t want any part of his campaign’s strategy. In contrast to the unrestrained attacks, Obama could hardly muster a cogent criticism of his opponent. His campaign workers have spent four years creating a grass-roots organization that values personal contact with voters above all else. Yet Obama showed none of the magnetism that made him unbeatable in 2008. In one night, he came perilously close to undermining his own campaign.
Historically, when the time comes to vote, the volatile poll numbers during the October debate season revert, roughly, to where they were before. Obama’s second-debate performance, which revealed an engaged and commanding candidate, may be enough to restore equilibrium. He is often at his best under pressure, and demographics and the Electoral College favor him. But Romney’s recovery in early October, a five-point swing, was larger than most recent challengers have achieved after one debate. The last leg of the race gives every indication of being very close, and Obama’s ground game will bear the full weight of the wager.♦
